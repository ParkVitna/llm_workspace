My cat isn't very picky usually and she ate this, we usually buy her the friskies prime filets, the vet said it is better to not change their diet and buy different types of food and flavors all the time so we normally stick with the chicken. I am glad this is a chicken formula since that is what she is used to. If it weren't so expensive I would buy it all the time but I do have to budget. I take good care of my animals but I have to watch the cost so that the humans can eat and pay bills. I am trying to get a baby kitten to start on solid foods and I am trying with this since it is quality and it is easier for him to try and eat than the filets.<br />It is a good quality cat food but it loses one star for being more than I can afford to buy on a constant basis and the cans are very small so it would take more cans to feed a cat.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe","variable_name":"df"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-e725609d-0be3-4ea6-b8be-ef74adff1e73\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Time</th>\n","      <th>ProductId</th>\n","      <th>UserId</th>\n","      <th>Score</th>\n","      <th>Summary</th>\n","      <th>Text</th>\n","      <th>n_tokens</th>\n","      <th>combined</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 0</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>1351123200</td>\n","      <td>B003XPF9BO</td>\n","      <td>A3R7JR3FMEBXQB</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>where does one  start...and stop... with a tre...</td>\n","      <td>Wanted to save some to bring to my Chicago fam...</td>\n","      <td>33</td>\n","      <td>where does one  start...and stop... with a tre...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>1351123200</td>\n","      <td>B003JK537S</td>\n","      <td>A3JBPC3WFUT5ZP</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>Arrived in pieces</td>\n","      <td>Not pleased at all.

But this comes close.  I got it for use in a \"Vegan pancake\" recipe.  We were having houseguests who were Vegan and I wanted to make some special breakfasts while they were here.  One of the cooking/recipe sites had a recipe using this and there were lots of great reviews.  I tried the recipe and it turned out like wallpaper paste -- yuck!&lt;br /&gt;However, the  so-called custard isn't so bad.  I think it's probably just cornstarch and annatto (yellow coloring with a slight flavor).  It's fun playing with it.  You could dress it up with fruit.  Seems to come out on the thin side when you make it as directed, so I use less milk because I like my custards to set firm.  As a custard sauce it's fine.  I would say it tastes something between a pudding and a custard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a really good egg-free \"custard\" get an original recipe for \"blanc mange.\"  It takes a lot longer to make, but it's certainly worth the difference.</th>\n","      <td>0.002299</td>\n","      <td>0.004840</td>\n","      <td>-0.043847</td>\n","      <td>-0.036250</td>\n","      <td>0.010121</td>\n","      <td>-0.053840</td>\n","      <td>0.042572</td>\n","      <td>0.004611</td>\n","      <td>0.046371</td>\n","      <td>-0.009974</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>0.004311</td>\n","      <td>-0.016213</td>\n","      <td>-0.010114</td>\n","      <td>-0.004264</td>\n","      <td>-0.005114</td>\n","      <td>0.011988</td>\n","      <td>0.006102</td>\n","      <td>0.013422</td>\n","      <td>-0.016366</td>\n","      <td>0.006679</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>These also have SALT and it's not sea salt.; I like the fact that you can see what you're getting and that there are no bones or dark meat.

One of the cooking/recipe sites had a recipe using this and there were lots of great reviews.  I tried the recipe and it turned out like wallpaper paste -- yuck!&lt;br /&gt;However, the  so-called custard isn't so bad.  I think it's probably just cornstarch and annatto (yellow coloring with a slight flavor).  It's fun playing with it.  You could dress it up with fruit.  Seems to come out on the thin side when you make it as directed, so I use less milk because I like my custards to set firm.  As a custard sauce it's fine.  I would say it tastes something between a pudding and a custard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a really good egg-free \"custard\" get an original recipe for \"blanc mange.\"  It takes a lot longer to make, but it's certainly worth the difference.</th>\n","      <td>[0.0022991024889051914, 0.004840383306145668, ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>These also have SALT and it's not sea salt.; I like the fact that you can see what you're getting and that there are no bones or dark meat.
