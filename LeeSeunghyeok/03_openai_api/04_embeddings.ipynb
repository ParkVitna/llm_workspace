But this comes close.  I got it for use in a \"Vegan pancake\" recipe.  We were having houseguests who were Vegan and I wanted to make some special breakfasts while they were here.  One of the cooking/recipe sites had a recipe using this and there were lots of great reviews.  I tried the recipe and it turned out like wallpaper paste -- yuck!&lt;br /&gt;However, the  so-called custard isn't so bad.  I think it's probably just cornstarch and annatto (yellow coloring with a slight flavor).  It's fun playing with it.  You could dress it up with fruit.  Seems to come out on the thin side when you make it as directed, so I use less milk because I like my custards to set firm.  As a custard sauce it's fine.  I would say it tastes something between a pudding and a custard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a really good egg-free \"custard\" get an original recipe for \"blanc mange.\"  It takes a lot longer to make, but it's certainly worth the difference.</th>\n","      <td>[0.0020295188296586275, 0.004446823615580797, ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>These also have SALT and it's not sea salt.;I like the fact that you can see what you're getting and that there are no bones or dark meat.
