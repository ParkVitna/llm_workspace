I am glad this is a chicken formula since that is what she is used to. If it weren't so expensive I would buy it all the time but I do have to budget. I take good care of my animals but I have to watch the cost so that the humans can eat and pay bills.

I think it's probably just cornstarch and annatto (yellow coloring with a slight flavor).  It's fun playing with it.  You could dress it up with fruit.  Seems to come out on the thin side when you make it as directed, so I use less milk because I like my custards to set firm.  As a custard sauce it's fine.

Then they miraculously found them and said that they would deliver within a week.  That was two weeks into a guaranted 2-day delivery.  I reordered and got the new order in before the scheduled delivery date.  Well, the scheduled delivery date came and went with no dog treats and no call from the USPS.  Amazon did reimburse me for the first order though.  In summary...treats good...USPS...sucks!
