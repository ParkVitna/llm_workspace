One of the cooking/recipe sites had a recipe using this and there were lots of great reviews.  I tried the recipe and it turned out like wallpaper paste -- yuck!&lt;br /&gt;However, the  so-called custard isn't so bad.  I think it's probably just cornstarch and annatto (yellow coloring with a slight flavor).  It's fun playing with it.  You could dress it up with fruit.  Seems to come out on the thin side when you make it as directed, so I use less milk because I like my custards to set firm.  As a custard sauce it's fine.  I would say it tastes something between a pudding and a custard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a really good egg-free \"custard\" get an original recipe for \"blanc mange.\"  It takes a lot longer to make, but it's certainly worth the difference.</th>\n","      <td>[0.0022991024889051914, 0.004840383306145668, ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>These also have SALT and it's not sea salt.; I like the fact that you can see what you're getting and that there are no bones or dark meat.

I cooked grilled chicken breasts, beef cooked every way, even lean pork chops...no deal...It is very grueling to watch your only baby starving!!! I tried 32 flavors of dog food. He has always preferred dry food over canned food. So I was perusing the dog food offered by my \"hero sight\" Amazon,and something about Halo Spots Stew caught my attention. For days I went back and forth between flavors that my pooch would find appealing. Finally, I settled on the adult lamb recipe. After ordering I thought \"Oh no, the kibble is going to be too large for his small mouth\"( Am I neurotic, doting mother or what?) Anyone who thinks I am totally disgusting doesn't know what this situation is like!! I was prepared to chop the dog food in my food processor...BUT, the food arrived quickly, as usual for Amazon, and what a surprise!!! Upon opening the bag of food, to my pleasant surprise, the smell of the food was so good..so fresh.. and the kibble is so small!!
