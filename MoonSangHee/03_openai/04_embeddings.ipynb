But this comes close.  I got it for use in a \"Vegan pancake\" recipe.  We were having houseguests who were Vegan and I wanted to make some special breakfasts while they were here.  One of the cooking/recipe sites had a recipe using this and there were lots of great reviews.  I tried the recipe and it turned out like wallpaper paste -- yuck!&lt;br /&gt;However, the  so-called custard isn't so bad.  I think it's probably just cornstarch and annatto (yellow coloring with a slight flavor).  It's fun playing with it.  You could dress it up with fruit.  Seems to come out on the thin side when you make it as directed, so I use less milk because I like my custards to set firm.  As a custard sauce it's fine.  I would say it tastes something between a pudding and a custard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a really good egg-free \"custard\" get an original recipe for \"blanc mange.\"  It takes a lot longer to make, but it's certainly worth the difference.</th>\n","      <td>[0.0022991024889051914, 0.004840383306145668, ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>These also have SALT and it's not sea salt.; I like the fact that you can see what you're getting and that there are no bones or dark meat.

Problem this time was with the UPS delivery.  They left the box in front of my garage door in the middle of the driveway. Because of this odd delivery location, my wife ran over the box when she backed out of the garage and did not see the box.  we lost half of the cups.
